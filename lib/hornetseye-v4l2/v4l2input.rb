      # Open a camera device for input
      #
      # The device is opened and a list of supported resolutions is handed back as
      # parameter to the code block. The code block must return the selected mode
      # so that initialisation can be completed. If no block is given, the highest
      # available resolution is selected after giving colour modes preference.
      #
      # @example Open a camera device
      #   require 'hornetseye_v4l2'
      #   include Hornetseye
      #   camera = V4L2Input.new { |modes| modes.last }
      #
      # @param [String] device The device file name.
      # @param [Integer] channel Number of the input channel to use.
      # @param [Proc] action An optional block for selecting the desired video mode.
      # @return [V4L2Input] An object for accessing the camera.
